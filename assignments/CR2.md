# Report 2: Solution of nonlinear quasi-static problems

Choose your project here:

https://goo.gl/forms/dwmxSOg5TTuzJrtw2

In the report you should discuss through an example the following essential
points treated in the second and third parts of the course

- Newton–Raphson algorithm
- Linearized buckling analysis
- Stability of solutions
- Nonlinear elasticity
- Linearizations
- Bifurcation and post-bifurcation analysis
- Discussion of issues aring in the numerical solutions of nonlinear systems
(possible non-convergence, convergence to an unstable solution, need for the
introduction of imperfections, etc…)

We propose three different examples on which to work to discuss these point in
your final project:

1. Buckling and postbuckling of an elastic beam with 1d and 3d models: TP 2.2
and TP 3.1.
2. Lateral buckling of beams in 3d (Déversement), see the related pdf
3. Morphing of Geometric Composites via Residual Swelling, reproducing some of
the numerical results of the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03010.pdf by 3d
FE analysis and an hyperelastic material model
 
**Some suggestions:**
 - Write concisely and effectively.
 - Comment your results.
 - The quality of the figures is important.
 - Report only the minimal number of figures (of excellent quality) to effectively communicate your results.
 - You can write in English of French.
 - Use Latex or Jupyter notebooks for writing your report. But if you use Jupyter notebooks, the format should be professional and you should produce a pdf as output. 

**Important informations:**
  - Deadline: January, 7th 2019 
  - To submit your report: 
      - a paper copy of your report should be returned at the oral examination. One paper version per group is sufficient.
      - an electronic version should be submitted to your "student" repository that you have created for the first report. One repository per group and one report per group is sufficient.
      - In your "student" repository you should: 
          1. Create a directory called `CR2`
          2. Put your report in the pdf form named as `5AG07-CR2-studentname1-studentname2.pdf` (file with a different naming scheme will not be accepted and evaluated. 
          3. Put all your files you used to obtain your results in `CR2/src` (namely the *.py and *.ipynb files)
  - There is not a specific requirement on the length of the manuscript. It should as short as possible to communicate all important information you want to put in the report. 
  - We will evaluate the quality of the presentation (language, typesetting, and figures). Being able to effectively communicate your results is important for your future.
  - We require you to be able to use git at least to push your data to the repository. This is the main reason why we ask to submit your CR on the github platform. We will not accept submissions by mail.
